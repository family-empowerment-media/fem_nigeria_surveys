# ── Free-text station-name canonicalization ─────────────────────────────────
# 2026-08-26: station_most_listened / station_listened_yesterday /
# station_past_7_days are `select_multiple station` in the XLSForm, but the
# raw mapped-data column holds literal write-in text, not resolved
# choice-list values -- so the same real station shows up under dozens of
# spelling/case/punctuation variants ("Royal FM", "ROYALE FM", "Radio royal
# FM"...), confirmed by inspecting the pre-aggregated (non-PII) output, not
# raw respondent rows. This section normalizes those mechanically -- accent/
# case fold, strip trailing frequency numbers and parentheticals, strip the
# bare words "radio"/"fm" -- and groups matches into one canonical label per
# cluster, preferring the exact XLSForm 'station' choice-list spelling
# whenever a cluster matches one of the 23 official station names (confirmed
# against [Fon]+Benin+Questionnaire+d'Enquete.xlsx's choices sheet, not
# guessed). Only single-letter/word variants that mechanical normalization
# can't distinguish from a genuinely different station are left alone.

# stays split unless it's an exact mechanical match -- e.g. "Lama" vs "La
# Voix de la Lama" are NOT merged here, since there's no way to confirm from
